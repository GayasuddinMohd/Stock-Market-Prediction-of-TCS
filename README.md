# Stock Market Prediction of TCS  
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task in the realm of finance and data analysis. In this analysis, we will use the Linear Regression algorithm to predict the stock prices of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) based on historical data. Linear Regression aims to establish a linear relationship between input variables (such as time) and the target variable (stock price).

# Technologies Used  
* Python
* Machine learning
  
 # Result  
 On that day the TCS stock price was open at 1998.00 (INR), and our model is predicting 2001.75159573 (INR).Hence we can say that our model is overall good in terms of prediction.
