# ðŸŒ¼  Stock Market  ðŸŒ¼
The stock market is where investors buy and sell shares of companies. It's a set of exchanges where companies issue shares and other securities for trading. It also includes over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces where investors trade securities directly with each other (rather than through an exchange)

# ðŸŒ¼  Stock Market Prediction  ðŸŒ¼
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task in the realm of finance and data analysis. In this analysis, we will use the Linear Regression algorithm to predict the stock prices of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) based on historical data. Linear Regression aims to establish a linear relationship between input variables (such as time) and the target variable (stock price).

# ðŸŒ¼  Repository Overview  ðŸŒ¼
This repository is about the prediction of the stock price of the TCS.
   - It has a python notebook where all the coding has been done.
   - It also has the relevant datasets and files used for this analysis.

# ðŸŒ¼  Technologies Used  ðŸŒ¼
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* Jupyter Notebok
* Kaggle
* Statistics
* scikit-learn
* ML Algorithms

 # ðŸŒ¼  Summary  ðŸŒ¼
 On that day the TCS stock price was open at 1998.00 (INR), and our model is predicting 2001.75159573 (INR).Hence we can say that our model is overall good in terms of prediction.

# ðŸŒ¼  Conclusion  ðŸŒ¼
The Stock Market Prediction analysis of TCS using Linear Regression showcases the potential of predictive modeling in the financial domain. While this simplified approach focuses on a single variable, real-world stock price predictions consider multiple variables, market sentiments, and external factors. Linear Regression serves as a starting point for more advanced algorithms.

As we engage in this analysis, we recognize the complexity of stock price prediction and its significance in investment decisions and portfolio management. Linear Regression provides a foundation for more sophisticated techniques that incorporate technical indicators, market trends, and sentiment analysis to enhance prediction accuracy and inform financial strategies.
